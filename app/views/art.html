<p>Understanding human behaviour is largely at the heart of surveillance.</p>

<p>The Snowden revelations introduce us to various tactics and strategies carried out by the UK's Government Communications Headquarter (GCHQ) in attempts to engage in misinformation campaigns and to subvert online discourse. The GCHQ refers to such strategies as <b>“Art of Deception”</b> and <b>“Art of the Possible”</b>.</p>

<h4>Art of Deception</h4> 

<p>The <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">"Art of Deception"</a> is a strategy through which the GCHQ attempts to analyze and understand human behaviour and to deceive individuals, groups and societies through misinformation campaigns and by subverting online discourse. This includes the use of psychological manipulation and social engineering techniques in an attempt to entrap and attack targets.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">leaked documents</a>, the “Art of Deception” is carried out through a multidisciplinary approach to understanding human behaviour, which brings together specialists from the fields of political science, biology, history, economics, psychology, anthropology and sociology. The aim is to create so-called “cyber magicians” who carry out the following <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">"magic techniques"</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deception of individuals through psychological manipulation, with the aim of <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">discrediting their reputation</a> and disrupting their profession</li>
<li>Disruption of groups' creativity through the use of various techniques</li>
<li>Influence global media through the spread of propaganda</li>
</ul>

<p>Who is a target and how? According to the <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">leaked documents</a>, the GCHQ's “Art of Deception”  targets the following actors through the following platforms:</p>

<p><b>Individuals:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Phone voice</li>
<li>IM/IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Communities of Interest:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Phone voice</li>
<li>IM/IRC</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Emails</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Global:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>News media</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Linkedln</li>
<li>Webpages</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of deception though as a tactic by intelligence agencies is nothing new. For all we know, the GCHQ's <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">"Art of Deception"</a> might even possibly be inspired by China's <a href="http://www.chinapage.com/sunzi-e.html">"Art of War"</a>, which is an ancient Chinese military treatise that puts great emphasis on deception tactics in warfare. Misinformation and various other <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a215721.pdf">deception tactics have widely been employed during both world wars</a> and generally throughout history.</p> 

<p>But who does the GCHQ even mean by “individuals” and “communities of interest”? If deception tactics are carried out in secret, how can there be accountability in terms of ethics and legitimacy?</p> 

<p>Given that the GCHQ has <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/revelations#gchq-tempora-porgramme">direct access to the fibre optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet</a>  and has indiscriminate access to most communications, who can ensure that targets are actually “legitimate” and how?</p>

<h4>Art of the Possible</h4>

<p>The GCHQ's <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snowden_cyber_offensive1_nbc_document.pdf">"Art of the Possible"</a> attempts to target individuals and groups through “honey traps”, to amend or delete social media presences and to discredit blog posts.</p> 

<p>Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Flickr appear to be platforms through which the GCHQ aims to carry out the <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">following tactics</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Propaganda</li>
<li>Deception</li>
<li>Mass messaging</li>
<li>Pushing stories</li>
<li>Alias development</li>
<li>Psychological manipulation of targets</li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/categories/viral-messages.png" class="category-image"/>

<p>Through such tactics, the GCHQ aimed towards <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snowden_cyber_offensive1_nbc_document.pdf">disrupting the work of targets, discrediting their reputation and generally subverting online discourse</a> through misinformation campaigns. And in some cases, the GCHQ's <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snowden_cyber_offensive1_nbc_document.pdf">Computer Network Attack (CNA) carried out denial of service attacks</a> against its targets.</p>

<p>The leaked documents indicate that intelligence agencies collect huge volumes of data through most digital services with the aim of not only identifying potential targets, but of also influencing individuals, groups and societies at large. To what degree should this be legitimate?</p>
