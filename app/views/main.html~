        <h4>Political leaders under surveillance</h4>
        <p>This section illustrates the politics of surveillance through which some countries have had unequal political advantage in global affairs and negotiations.</p>

        <p>As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, intelligence agencies spied on numerous international political leaders – including allies – to help their governments influence negotiations to their advantage. </p>

        <p>Such espionage has targeted the communications of international government representatives attending global summits, such as the <b>Copenhagen Climate Summit</b>, the <b>G20 Summits</b> in Toronto and London, as well as negotiations at the <b>United Nations Security Council</b> and the <b>trans-Atlantic free trade agreement.</b></p>

        <h4>Collaboration between intelligence agencies and companies</h4>
        <p>
        This section illustrates the public-private partnerships of surveillance which have targeted the communications of citizens and government representatives around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
        As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, many of the internet companies that we trust have worked hand-in-hand with intelligence agencies to develop surveillance back-doors, while other popular telecoms service providers have helped intelligence agencies intercept undersea cables.

        <h4>Collaboration between intelligence agencies</h4>
        <p>This section illustrates some of the collaborations between intelligence agencies around the world.</p>

        <p>As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, such collaborations have targeted the communications of flight passengers, online gamers, corporations, law firms, government representatives and in some cases, the public at large. </p>

        </p>
        <p>

        <h4>Mass surveillance of citizens</h4>
        <img src="/images/categories/mass-surveillance.png" class="category-image"/>
        <p>Almost all of our communications, worldwide, are routinely being collected and analysed, according to the Snowden revelations. Unfortunately, “ordinary” law-abiding citizens around the world are not immune to intelligence agencies' prying eyes.</p>
        <p>While governments and intelligence agencies justify surveillance on the grounds of detecting and preventing crime and terror, the documents leaked by Snowden reveal that they follow a “collect it all” strategy which involves the indiscriminate bulk collection of most communications. This includes millions of **Yahoo web cam images**,  the real time monitoring of users' activity on popular social media platforms – such as **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **Blogger** and **YouTube** – and the monitoring of “nearly everything a user does on the internet”.</p>

        <img src="/images/categories/targeted-surveillance.png" class="category-image"/>
        <h4>Targeted surveillance of citizens</h4>
        <p>Tens of thousands of computer networks have been infected with malware by the NSA. Backdoors have been added to computer network devices, such as routers and servers, and attempts to crack crypto and to exploit VPNs and anonymity software have been carried out.</p>
        <p>Cyber attacks have not only targeted suspect terrorists, but also non-profit organisations - such as France's Doctors of the World - system administrators, hacktivists, media organizations, Pirate Bay website staff and visitors, and even online gamers.</p>
