However, the huge amount of documents which have been leaked (and which continue to be leaked) are quite overwhelming, thus potentially limiting the ability to correlate revelations contextually, to raise questions and to take action. Surveillance without Borders was developed in an attempt to address this problem. </p> <p>The project includes a global data map which classifies all of the Snowden revelations for each country around the world under the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Political leaders under surveillance</li> <li>Corporations under surveillance</li> <li>Collaboration between corporations and intelligence agencies</li> <li>Collaboration between intelligence agencies around the world</li> <li>Mass surveillance of citizens (to be released soon)</li> <li>Targeted surveillance of citizens (to be released soon)</li> </ul> <p>The aim of Surveillance without Borders is to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide an overview of (some of) the categories and types of information that are included in the Snowden revelations</li> <li>Enable access to information from the Snowden revelations </li> <li>Enable research and investigations on surveillance (on both global and local levels)</li> <li>Illustrate some of the political and economic interests behind surveillance </li> <li>Shed light on private-public partnerships involving the surveillance of citizens</li> </ul> <p>Through its global data map, Surveillance without Borders aims to enable researchers, journalists, activists, advocates and the public at large to quickly and easily gain access to information which is more specific to their local context. Hopefully this will not only contribute to more research and public awareness raising, but also to more global actions towards transparency and accountability. </p>'),a.put("views/main.html",'<div class="row info-box" ng-switch="selectedCategory"> <div ng-switch-when="Leaders"> <img src="/images/categories/political-leaders.fd51be0c.png" class="category-image"> <h4>Political leaders under surveillance</h4> <p>This section illustrates the politics of surveillance through which some countries have had unequal political advantage in global affairs and negotiations.</p> <p>As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, intelligence agencies spied on numerous international political leaders – including allies – to help their governments influence negotiations to their advantage. </p> <p>Such espionage has targeted the communications of international government representatives attending global summits, such as the <b>Copenhagen Climate Summit</b>, the <b>G20 Summits</b> in Toronto and London, as well as negotiations at the <b>United Nations Security Council</b> and the <b>trans-Atlantic free trade agreement.</b></p> </div> <div ng-switch-when="Corporate collaboration"> <img src="/images/categories/collaboration-intelligence-corporations.1f1890b8.png" class="category-image"> <h4>Collaboration between intelligence agencies and companies</h4> <p> This section illustrates the public-private partnerships of surveillance which have targeted the communications of citizens and government representatives around the world. </p> <p> As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, many of the internet companies that we trust have worked hand-in-hand with intelligence agencies to develop surveillance back-doors, while other popular telecoms service providers have helped intelligence agencies intercept undersea cables. </p> </div> <div ng-switch-when="Intelligence"> <img src="/images/categories/collaboration-intelligence.4273278f.png" class="category-image"> <h4>Collaboration between intelligence agencies</h4> <p>This section illustrates some of the collaborations between intelligence agencies around the world.</p> <p>As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, such collaborations have targeted the communications of flight passengers, online gamers, corporations, law firms, government representatives and in some cases, the public at large. </p> </div> <div ng-switch-when="Corporations"> <img src="/images/categories/corporations.ef58a1a5.png" class="category-image"> <h4>Corporations under surveillance</h4> <p> This section illustrates some of the companies that have been targeted by intelligence agencies around the world. </p> <p> As illustrated by the Snowden revelations, intelligence agencies have exploited the networks of telecom service providers and have even tapped into the communication links between the data centres of some of the most major Internet companies. </p> </div> <div ng-switch-when="Mass"> <h4>Mass surveillance of citizens</h4> <img src="/images/categories/mass-surveillance.09efadcf.png" class="category-image"> <p>While governments and intelligence agencies justify surveillance on the grounds of detecting and preventing crime and terror, the documents leaked by Snowden reveal that they follow a “collect it all” strategy which involves the indiscriminate bulk collection of most communications.</p> <p> This includes the collection of millions of Yahoo web cam images, the real time monitoring of users\' activity on popular social media platforms – such as Facebook, Twitter, Blogger and YouTube – and the monitoring of “nearly everything a user does on the internet”.
