However, the huge amount of documents which have been leaked (and which continue to be leaked) are quite overwhelming, thus potentially limiting the ability to correlate revelations contextually, to raise questions and to take action. Surveillance without Borders was developed in an attempt to address this problem. </p> <p>The project includes a global data map which classifies all of the Snowden revelations for each country around the world under the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Political leaders under surveillance</li> <li>Corporations under surveillance</li> <li>Collaboration between corporations and intelligence agencies</li> <li>Collaboration between intelligence agencies around the world</li> <li>Mass surveillance of citizens</li> <li>Targeted surveillance of citizens</li> </ul> <p>The aim of Surveillance without Borders is to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide an overview of (some of) the categories and types of information that are included in the Snowden revelations</li> <li>Enable access to information from the Snowden revelations </li> <li>Enable research and investigations on surveillance (on both global and local levels)</li> <li>Illustrate some of the political and economic interests behind surveillance </li> <li>Shed light on private-public partnerships involving the surveillance of citizens</li> </ul> <p>Through its global data map, Surveillance without Borders aims to enable researchers, journalists, activists, advocates and the public at large to quickly and easily gain access to information which is more specific to their local context. Hopefully this will not only contribute to more research and public awareness raising, but also to more global actions towards transparency and accountability. </p> <p>A project by <b><a href="https://boomerang-effect.espivblogs.net/">Maria Xynou</a></b>.</p> <p><b>Contact:</b> maria.x@espiv.net</p> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/surveillance-without-borders">Github</a></b></p>'),a.put("views/art.html",'<p>Understanding <b>human behaviour</b> is largely at the heart of surveillance.</p> <img src="/images/art-images/emotional-decisions.c46a2cdf.png"> <p>The Snowden revelations introduce us to various tactics and strategies carried out by the UK\'s Government Communications Headquarter (GCHQ) in attempts to engage in misinformation campaigns and to subvert online discourse. The GCHQ refers to such strategies as <b>“Art of Deception”</b> and <b>“Art of the Possible”</b>.</p> <b><h4>Art of Deception</h4></b> <p>The <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">"Art of Deception"</a> is a strategy through which the GCHQ attempts to analyze and understand human behaviour and to deceive individuals, groups and societies through misinformation campaigns and by subverting online discourse. This includes the use of psychological manipulation and social engineering techniques in an attempt to entrap and attack targets.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">leaked documents</a>, the “Art of Deception” is carried out through a multidisciplinary approach to understanding human behaviour, which brings together specialists from the fields of political science, biology, history, economics, psychology, anthropology and sociology. The aim is to create so-called “cyber magicians” who carry out the following <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">"magic techniques"</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Deception of individuals through psychological manipulation, with the aim of <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">discrediting their reputation</a> and disrupting their profession</li> <li>Disruption of groups\' creativity through the use of various techniques</li> <li>Influence global media through the spread of propaganda</li> </ul> <img src="/images/art-images/cyber-magicians.db5af7d1.png"> <p>Who is a target and how? According to the <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-art-of-deception-training-for-a-new.pdf">leaked documents</a>, the GCHQ\'s “Art of Deception” targets the following actors through the following platforms:</p> <b><p>Individuals:</p></b> <ul> <li>Emails</li> <li>SMS</li> <li>Phone voice</li> <li>IM/IRC</li> </ul> <b><p>Communities of Interest:</p></b> <ul> <li>Phone voice</li> <li>IM/IRC</li> <li>Twitter</li> <li>Facebook</li> <li>Blogs</li> <li>Emails</li> </ul> <b><p>Global:</p></b> <ul> <li>News media</li> <li>Twitter</li> <li>Linkedln</li> <li>Webpages</li> </ul> <img src="/images/art-images/deception-targets.75965511.png"> <p>The use of deception though as a tactic by intelligence agencies is nothing new.
